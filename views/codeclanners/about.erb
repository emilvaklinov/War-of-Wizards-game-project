<p> This game was created by Emil Vaklinov, a student at Codeclan cohort E23(Edinburgh). It's a Ruby/PostgreSQL/HTML/Sinatra solo student project.</p>
<p> To create the game, I used all of the methods that I learned during the first 4 weeks of studying! </p>
<p> The idea of the game is to help begginer programmers or kids learn how to code!</p>
<p> For each spell you have to write a code which will block the spell and protect you!</p>
<p> This is the trial not commercial version released on 25 of July 2018!</p>

<p> "This War is between the new code wizards at CodeClan academy and the dark side of Hogwarts wizardry school.</p>
<p> Lord Valdemort wants to control the codebase system, to get into the Castle of the CodeClanners to enslave them.</p>
<p> We can't escape... We have to fight!!!</p>
